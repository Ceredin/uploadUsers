# uploadUsers

A PHP script that is executed from the command line that accepts a CSV file as input and processes the CSV file.
Assumptions I have made with this task are written out in comments in the code.

PLEASE BE AWARE
This is not a working program. I have put in pseudo(ish) code for what I would like to continue to do. But I feel like I still have a ways to go.
